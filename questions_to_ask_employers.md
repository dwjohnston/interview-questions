These questions are ordered generally chronologically - you would ask the questions at the top, earlier in the process. 


## Are you hiring for a specific role and team? 

**Person to ask** - HR representative at early stages. 

**Purpose** - This question is to manage your own expectations about the process. If they are recruiting for a specific role, you might want to tailor your responses for that role. If they are recruiting generally - you are probably better being more upfront about what kind of work you want to do. 

Also, if you get rejected for a role, if they are were recruiting for a specific role, then it might pay to still apply for other roles with other teams. 


## Who would I report to/take technical direction from? 

**Person to ask** - Engineering manager

This question might not be that helpful if they haven't determined the team you would be joining. 

It may also pay to ask this question again in the late stages of the process. 

**Purpose** - Set expectations for yourself, be clear before you accept the offer about what your role in the organisation is. 

## Who is the customer/client that is currently best served by your product?

**Person to ask** Engineering manager

**Purpose** - If they can't answer it or give a fudgey answer, it indicates that the product is spinning in the mud. 


## Who is the customer/client that you are currently trying to win over

**Person to ask** Engineering manager

**Purpose** - As above, and gives you an indication of what the company is doing, what direction they are heading. 

## What do you like most about working here?

**Person to ask** - A developer. 

**Purpose** - Is a good open ended cultural question, gives you a good indication of what the place is like. 

## Do you use your product internally? 

Only applies for certain products. 

If they're not, it demonstrates that the product doesn't work very well. 

## What do you like the least about working here?

A more diplomatic phrasing would be - 'What are the difficult parts of the code that you have trouble with'. 

**Person to ask** - A developer. 

**Purpose** - If they dodge the question, it indicates a lack of honesty or forthright communication IMO, there's likely to be office politics at play, or it indicates that they're not confident that the company is worth working despite whatever difficulties they have. 

## What does a successful candidate look like? 

**Alternative phrasing** Six months after hiring a candidate, how would you know you had made a good hire? 

**Person to ask** - Engineering manager 

**Purpose** Gives you a picture of what they're really looking for. Are they looking for someone to take responsibility for things and propose new innovations? Or are they looking for someone to follow directions? 

## How long does the interview process take? When can I expect to recieve a decision on my application? 

**Person to ask** Engineering or hiring manager

**Purpose** If you've got other roles in the process too, it can be helpful to know what timing might look like. Also, by asking them to give a date it helps you in the scenario that they're 'keeping you warm' while they've got other candidates they want to investigate. They might still string you along, but at least you have a hint at what's happening. 

## How does this job compare to your previous role? 

**Person to ask** - A developer

**Purpose** - I really like this question. It's basically asking 'What's it like to work here?' with different framing. By asking them to compare it with a previous role, it's going to highlight various aspects of current role, that someone might not have otherwise thought about. 

## What are the expectations for working the office? What are the norms? 

**Person to ask** Hiring manager, Engineering manager

**Purpose** It's a good thing to get clear. 

## What personal development programs exist in the organisation? 10% time, paid courses, etc. 

**Person to ask** Hiring manager, Engineering manager

**Purpose** Demonstrates inclination to continuous improvement. 

## What does the performance review process look like?

**Person to ask** - Engineering manager, HR representative. 

- How often does it happen? 
- Is there a maximum on the kind of raise that can be given in a year? 
- Is there a bonus? 
- Who determines my performance? 

**Purpose** - The answer to this question likely won't affect whether you want to work for the company or not. But it's good for you to know up front what the process is.

## What hardware do you use/operating system/tools

**Purpose** - This is more important to ask if interviewing for a large enterprise or government department. If it matters to you, you might not want to work at a place where you're stuck using a crappy computer. 


## Is the company profitable? 

**Ask if** it's a small company or start up. 

Unprofitable start ups are going to be pivoting a lot more as they try to find what works. This might be fine for you, but it's good to know what you're getting into.

## Can you tell me about a time you've had to manage a difficult team member? 

**Ask if** they've asked you a similar question. 

I'm curious what their response will be. 

## Can I have my feedback on my application? 

**Ask if** you were unsuccessful after an interview. 

**Ask especially if** the company values statement mentions 'giving feedback', 'honest conversations' etc. 

It can be really helpful to find out what went wrong.
